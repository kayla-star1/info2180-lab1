           <h2>Kayla Swift</h2>
           <p>Hello! My name is Kayla Swift, and I grew up in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Gem of the Antilles. Living in the country gave me the opportunity to develop a fondness for the beach and the outdoors. When I was younger, I was dubbed "the fish" because I never wanted to leave the beach. 
            I'm now pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an Electronics minor. I have always wanted to be free and see the globe, and that is exactly what I am going to do. I am going to start with a tour of Asia and Europe. After a period of travel, I would like to work for a firm that is committed to being environmentally friendly and sustainable. My family has always emphasized the importance of education, and I intend to get a master's degree and ultimately a PhD.
            My interest in Web Development merely started as an elective but after a review of the course, my interest was ampified. Webpage are the first things you see when you open a browser and learning the building blocks behind it is riveting. </p>
